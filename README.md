# Decentralized Crowd Funding

This project is a decentralized crowd funding platform. How it works, is a user would select a campaign that they want to support by contributing Ethereum's native token, ether.

Once the campaign's minimum threshold is met, the contributors are then able to vote on "requests" made by the manager of the account as to how they want to spend the funds.

This allows contributors that have some say into how the funds are used in the project and prevents the campaign managers from taking the funds for themselves.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

First, navigate to the directory where you wish to clone the github repo. Next, copy the text under the "clone or download" button above. In your command line, run the following command:

```
git clone {copied text}
```

After you have successfully cloned the repo locally, run the following command in the command line:

```
npm init
```
This will set up the project with all of its dependencies.

You will also need to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) on your browser,
